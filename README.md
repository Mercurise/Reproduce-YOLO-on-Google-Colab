## "YOLO Taster" 

> A simple short script for deploying and running pre-trained YOLO model on your machine

This script provides simple codes for "copy-paste-run" YOLO on your machine or cloud, which is stuitable for a "first-touch", fast showcase and a basic understanding about YOLO model. The main steps are shown as followings:



*   Download YOLO from GitHub Repository
*   Compile Model at local machine
*   Execute a reference demo
*   Visualise detection results
